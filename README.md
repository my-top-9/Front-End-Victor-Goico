# My-Top-Nine
Do you remember MySpace Top 8 friends? Well, this is MyTopNine - a website that lets users select their Top-Nine in a variety of categories (sports, video games, makeup, movies, etc..). This project is a marketing/landing page for the My-Top-Nine web application, as well as an About Us page for our team.
